• All flow control structures in CAOS! (exhaustive)
	https://github.com/Creatures-Developer-Network/c2e-quirks/issues/53

• All things which can break out of INST mode
	https://github.com/Creatures-Developer-Network/c2e-quirks/issues/52
	• INST, SLOW, WAIT (in our system these will be treated like flow controls that change how CAOS code is compiled, but LOCK/UNLK don't need to be)
	• OVER
	• TOUC
	• STOP, STPT


• All L-Values—ie, writable things you can use SETV on (exhaustive)

	+ These are important because they're very special in this system!  To make CAOS compatible with a byval system like Java and our CAOS interpreter, we must convert them (in both interpreted and compiled caos!) to a SETx and some expression (eg, ADDV_(decimal) VAR(decimal) SUM(decimal) so ADDV va00 va01 becomes SETV va00 ADDV_ va00 va01).
		+ Youch!  I might just add a (slower) extension system for byref things for those last block since networking and pray aren't core language features XD'



• Can do an Implicit SLOW and so compilation treats it as a script-break
	https://github.com/Creatures-Developer-Network/c2e-quirks/issues/56
	• SLOW
	• CALL
	
	• WAIT
	• OVER
	• TOUC
	• NET: RUSO
	• NET: STAT
	• NET: WHON
	
	• CALT, CALA









• Not flow control, just normal functions/commands useful for similar things!
	• CALL
	• MESG WRIT / MESG WRT+
	• PAUS
	• KILL
	• CAOS
	• EAMN
	• GAMN
