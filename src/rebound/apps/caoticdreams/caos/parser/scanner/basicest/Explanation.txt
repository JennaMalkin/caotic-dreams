This is the minimalist possible level possible of caos parsing XD

It never fails! XD
That is, it doesn't validate the code correctness at *all* XD'

But it parses it to a level at which you don't have to worry about a character (eg, asterisk meaning comment) being in a string literal and thus not actually meaning what you think it does!
Everything not in one of the categories (some (but not all!) literals, and comments) is lumped into "code" X3

This is what I call a "flat and complete" parser, meaning the token types have no tree structural data, and it simply "colors" each character (codepoint) with one of the token type "colors" of BasicCaosTokenType X3

The output of this is fed to GeneralCAOSParser to finish scanning-parsing into tokens :3


This could easily be useful for much more than the CaoticDreams engine!  It could (todo: will!) be used for Jagent's CAOS2PRAY parsing (to finally make it super proper XD)!  :D
