:D!



===Backwards compatible!===
• INST? / SLOW?  directives in comments
	Like INST/SLOW but only if INST blocks are fast—namely, if INST blocks are compiled, and ignored if compilation isn't done :3



===Backwards incompatible===
• CALT - CALl Targ
	CALL on TARG instead of OWNR! :D

• SETX
	SETV/SETA/SETS/etc. but doesn't make you know the type ahead of time (finally! XD )

• You can RETN from anywhere you like inside a SUBR! even inside a loop or doif-else or etc.!  :D

• PAUO - PAUs Other
	PAUS but throws error if given OWNR.  This way it can be used in compiled scripts since it never does an implicit SLOW.

• VA and OV (and MV) above 99!  :DD

• CAOS isn't limited to four letters!  (but we often use that bc it's cute and cultural :33 )

• Sound effects aren't limited to four letters!  (sdlfjsdflkj whyyyyy were they? XD )

• Message queues so MESG/CALT/etc.'ing agents won't abort/interrupt/overwrite the currently-running event script! :'D
	The MESG WRIT / MESG WRT+ commands still do it the old way by default, for backwards-compatibility, but there are new commands for it :3
	+ And the message queues are saved to / loaded from disk! :D

• Scheduled tasks (including MESG WRT+ !) that are saved to / loaded from disk! :D
	+ They work by treating time exclusively as an integer number of ticks :3

• SUBRs that return return values and accept parameters like real functions?! :D

• Expressions for arithmetic! :D
	• Like ADDV/SUBV but is a function that returns a value instead of being a command!
	• Ones for boolean things like <> and >=!  This both *fully* alleviates the need for parentheses (since only infix grammars need parentheses and it's MUCH easier to parse a language that doesn't need them!  And CAOS is *almost* a Polish (aka Prefix) Notation language!  And with these now it is fully :>   Also you can use them (booleans!) in normal code not just special "(condition)" commands like DOIF and UNTL! :D )

• Byte Strings a proper values not just for ANIM but can be stored in variables and stuff like text strings! :D
	• This also opens up a whole world of low-level binary file format parsing in CAOS 8>  XD

• Other datatypes potentially!  —Aiko wants arrays, for one! XD  :D
